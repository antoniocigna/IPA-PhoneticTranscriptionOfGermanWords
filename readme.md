IPA PhoneticTranscriptionOfGermanWords
--------------------------------------

This tool can be used to get the IPA phonetic trascription of a German word and play it. 

The dictionary used  is got from the 'de_dewikt.csv' file of 'german-ipa-dict-main' in (github) 	
adding a lower case word as a key before each row key.

Each word and a few others closer to it in the dictionary are shown with their trascription and can be played by a synthetic voice
